# Evolutionary-computing

A repository of algorithm studies for global optimization inspired by biological evolution.

# About

This repository is dedicated to the study of evolutionary algorithms (EAs) and genetic algorithm (GA) with Python. A genetic algorithm is a search heuristic inspired by [Darwin's theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution) of natural evolution. This algorithm reflects the process of natural selection, where the fittest individuals are selected for breeding in order to produce offspring for the next generation.

# Psuedocode

```python
START
Generate the initial population
Compute fitness
REPEAT
    Selection
    Crossover
    Mutation
    Compute fitness
UNTIL population has converged
STOP
```
