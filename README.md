# Evolutionary-computing

A repository of algorithm studies for global optimization inspired by biological evolution.

# About

This repository is dedicated to the study of evolutionary algorithms (EAs) and genetic algorithm (GA) with Python. A genetic algorithm is a search heuristic inspired by [Darwin's theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution) of natural evolution. This algorithm reflects the process of natural selection, where the fittest individuals are selected for breeding in order to produce offspring for the next generation.

# Psuedocode

Pseudocode of genetic algorithms

```python
START
Generate the initial population
Compute fitness
REPEAT
    Selection
    Crossover
    Mutation
    Compute fitness
UNTIL population has converged
STOP
```

"The travelling salesman problem (TSP) asks the following question: "Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city and returns to the origin city?" It is an NP-hard problem in combinatorial optimization, important in operations research and theoretical computer science." [Ref.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem)

2. [hello_world problem](https://github.com/renatogcruz/Evolutionary-computing/tree/master/ga_examples/hello_world)
